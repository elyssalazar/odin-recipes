        <p><h4>S'mores is EXTREMELY EASY to do. In fact, the only thing that you'd have to worry 
            about is the ingredients.</h4></p>
        <p><h4>S'mores are designed to be an enjoyable snack especially to campers. Here are the things you need to create s'mores:</h4></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chocolates (preferrably hersheys or any squared chocolates)</li>
            <li>Marshmallows</li>
            <li>Crackers (Grahams)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>See? You only need three ingredients to make a successful s'mores!</p>
        <p>Now, time to learn how to make one:</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the crackers in half (the size of the s'mores can entirely depend on you! Just vary on the 
                size of your marshmallows)</li>
            <li>Put the halfed crackers on the plate</li>
            <li>Place the marshamallows on top of the sliced crackers.</li>
            <li>Next, place them on the microwave. Put the microwave on high and heat it up for at least 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Once that is done, get your chocolates and half them (same size as the crackers)</li>
            <li>Get the other half of the crackers and place it on top of the chocolates (forming some sort of 
                sandwich)</li>
            <li>AND YOU'RE DONE!</li>
        </ol>
